# crypto-async
Native Cipher, Hash, and HMAC operations executed in Node's threadpool for
multi-core throughput.

## Motivation
#### Some issues with parts of the `crypto` module
* `crypto` cipher, hash and hmac streams are not really asynchronous. They
execute in C++, but only in the main thread and so they still block the event
loop. Encrypting 64 MB of data might block the event loop for +/- 70ms. Hashing
64 MB of data might block the event loop for +/- 190ms.
* These `crypto` operations do not take advantage of multiple CPU cores. Your
server may have 4 cores available but `crypto` will use only 1 of these 4 cores
for all encrypting and hashing operations.
* These `crypto` operations were not designed to use statically allocated
buffers. They allocate a new output buffer when encrypting or hashing data, even
if you already have an output buffer available. If you want to hash only a
portion of a buffer you must first create a slice. Thousands of JS object
allocations put unnecessary strain on the GC. This in turn leads to longer GC
pauses which also block the event loop.
* These `crypto` operations require multiple roundtrips between JS and C++ even
if you are only encrypting or hashing a single buffer.
* These `crypto` operations are not suitable for high-throughput network
protocols or filesystems which need to checksum and encrypt/decrypt large
amounts of data. Such a user-space network protocol or filesystem using `crypto`
might actually saturate a single CPU core with crypto operations before
saturating a fast local network or SSD disk.

#### Some new ideas with the `crypto-async` module
* Truly asynchronous. All calls execute asynchronously in the `node.js`
threadpool. This keeps the main thread and event loop free without blocking.
* Scalable across multiple CPU cores. While `crypto-async` is a fraction slower
per call than `crypto` (possibly because of the overhead of interacting with the
threadpool), for buffers larger than 1024 bytes it shines and provides N-cores
more throughput. `crypto-async` achieves up to 3x more throughput compared to
`crypto`.
* Zero-copy. All keys, ivs, source and target arguments can be passed directly
using offsets into existing buffers, without requiring any slices and without
allocating any temporary output buffers. This enables predictable memory usage
for programs with tight memory budgets.
* Designed to support the common use-case of encrypting or hashing a single
buffer, where memory is adequate and buffers are already in memory. This avoids
multiple round-trips between JS and C++.
* Separates the control plane and the data plane to enable high-throughput
applications.

## Installation
This will install `crypto-async` and compile the native binding automatically:
```
npm install @ronomon/crypto-async
```

## Usage

#### Adjust threadpool size and control concurrency
Node runs filesystem and DNS operations in the threadpool. The threadpool
consists of 4 threads by default. This means that at most 4 operations can be
running at any point in time. If any operation is slow to complete, it will
cause head-of-line blocking. The size of the threadpool should therefore be
increased at startup time (at the top of your script, before requiring any
modules) by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable (the absolute
maximum is 128 threads, which requires only ~1 MB memory in total according to
the [libuv docs](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/threadpool.html)).

Conventional wisdom would set the number of threads to the number of CPU cores,
but most operations running in the threadpool are not run hot, they are not
CPU-intensive and block mostly on IO. Issuing more IO operations than there are
CPU cores will increase throughput and will decrease latency per operation by
decreasing queueing time. On the other hand, `crypto-async` operations are
CPU-intensive. Issuing more `crypto-async` operations than there are CPU cores
will not increase throughput and will increase latency per operation by
increasing queueing time.

You should therefore:

1. Set the threadpool size to `IO` + `N`, where `IO` is the number of filesystem
and DNS operations you expect to be running concurrently, and where `N` is the
number of CPU cores available. This will reduce head-of-line blocking.

2. Allow or design for at most `N` `crypto-async` operations to be running
concurrently, where `N` is the number of CPU cores available. This will keep
latency within reasonable bounds.

```javascript
// At the top of your script, before requiring any modules:
process.env['UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE'] = 128;
```

#### Cipher
```javascript
var cryptoAsync = require('@ronomon/crypto-async');
var algorithm = 'AES-256-CTR';
var encrypt = 1; // 1 = Encrypt
var key = Buffer.alloc(32);
var iv = Buffer.alloc(16);
var plaintext = Buffer.alloc(128);
cryptoAsync.cipher(algorithm, encrypt, key, iv, plaintext,
  function(error, ciphertext) {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log(ciphertext.toString('hex'));
    var encrypt = 0; // 0 = Decrypt
    cryptoAsync.cipher(algorithm, encrypt, key, iv, ciphertext,
      function(error, plaintext) {
        if (error) throw error;
        console.log(plaintext.toString('hex'));
      }
    );
  }
);
```

#### Hash
```javascript
var cryptoAsync = require('@ronomon/crypto-async');
var algorithm = 'SHA256';
var source = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
cryptoAsync.hash(algorithm, source,
  function(error, hash) {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log(hash.toString('hex'));
  }
);
```

#### HMAC
```javascript
var cryptoAsync = require('@ronomon/crypto-async');
var algorithm = 'SHA256';
var key = Buffer.alloc(1024);
var source = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
cryptoAsync.hmac(algorithm, key, source,
  function(error, hmac) {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log(hmac.toString('hex'));
  }
);
```

### Zero-Copy Methods

The following method alternatives require more arguments but support zero-copy
crypto operations, for reduced memory overhead and GC pressure.

#### Cipher (Zero-Copy)
```javascript
var cryptoAsync = require('@ronomon/crypto-async');
var algorithm = 'AES-256-CTR';
var encrypt = 1; // 0 = Decrypt, 1 = Encrypt
var key = Buffer.alloc(1024);
var keyOffset = 4;
var keySize = 32;
var iv = Buffer.alloc(32);
var ivOffset = 2;
var ivSize = 16;
var source = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
var sourceOffset = 512;
var sourceSize = 32;
var target = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
var targetOffset = 32768;
cryptoAsync.cipher(
  algorithm,
  encrypt,
  key,
  keyOffset,
  keySize,
  iv,
  ivOffset,
  ivSize,
  source,
  sourceOffset,
  sourceSize,
  target,
  targetOffset,
  function(error, targetSize) {
    if (error) throw error;
    var slice = target.slice(targetOffset, targetOffset + targetSize);
    console.log(slice.toString('hex'));
  }
);
```

#### Hash (Zero-Copy)
```javascript
var cryptoAsync = require('@ronomon/crypto-async');
var algorithm = 'SHA256';
var source = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
var sourceOffset = 512;
var sourceSize = 65536;
var target = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
var targetOffset = 32768;
cryptoAsync.hash(
  algorithm,
  source,
  sourceOffset,
  sourceSize,
  target,
  targetOffset,
  function(error, targetSize) {
    if (error) throw error;
    var slice = target.slice(targetOffset, targetOffset + targetSize);
    console.log(slice.toString('hex'));
  }
);
```

#### HMAC (Zero-Copy)
```javascript
var cryptoAsync = require('@ronomon/crypto-async');
var algorithm = 'SHA256';
var key = Buffer.alloc(1024);
var keyOffset = 4;
var keySize = 8;
var source = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
var sourceOffset = 512;
var sourceSize = 65536;
var target = Buffer.alloc(1024 * 1024);
var targetOffset = 32768;
cryptoAsync.hmac(
  algorithm,
  key,
  keyOffset,
  keySize,
  source,
  sourceOffset,
  sourceSize,
  target,
  targetOffset,
  function(error, targetSize) {
    if (error) throw error;
    var slice = target.slice(targetOffset, targetOffset + targetSize);
    console.log(slice.toString('hex'));
  }
);
```

## Tests
`crypto-async` ships with a long-running fuzz test:

```
node test.js
```

## Benchmark
To benchmark `crypto-async` vs `crypto`:

## AEAD Ciphers

AEAD ciphers such as GCM are currently not supported and may be added in future
as an `aead` method.
